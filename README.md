<h1 style="font-style: bold; font-size: 25px;">BUILD</h1>

Build is a platform to connect charities with aspiring developers.
It was created by Team Build as our final project during the School of Code bootcamp. It was built using a mobile-first approach. You can find more details below.

<h1 style="font-style: bold; font-size: 25px;">The Problem</h1>
As bootcamp graduates ourselves, we realised there was a gap in the market. Charities often face challenges in establishing or maintaining their online presence. Meanwhile, our talented peers from the bootcamp seek real-world experience.

We surveyed charities and our fellow bootcampers to allow us to understand both problems and how best to solve them.

*and came up with the idea for Build!*

A platform to link charities and developers.

To allow charities to register and pitch projects.
 
and give aspiring developers the chance to register and vote for projects they want to work on.
