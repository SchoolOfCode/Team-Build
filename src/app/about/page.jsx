            As bootcamp graduates ourselves, we realised there was a gap in the market. Charities often face challenges in establishing or maintaining their online presence. Meanwhile, our talented peers from the bootcamp seek real-world experience. With a dedicated pool of experienced mentors to lead projects, Build was created to bridge this gap and leverage technology for charitable causes. 
            
            {/* Our vision is simple yet powerful â€” we want to harness the power of technology to help charities. Build is committed to making tech accessible to all. Our focus is on fostering an inclusive tech community and leveraging technology for charitable causes. Picture a future where technology reflects the stories of all of us. Build is here to make that happen. */}
